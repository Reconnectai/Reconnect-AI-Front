# Reconnect AI

## Character

To use the chat, you need to create a character with whom he wants to communicate. When creating it, you need to specify **a name, description, portrait, and voice sample**.

The name and description are used by language models at the first level to create a chatbot that imitates the style and manner of text communication of a specific character based on knowledge about him.

The voice sample is used to imitate this voice for voicing text messages received at the level above.

By combining the portrait and the generated voice message, we get a video response in which our character, depicted in the attached picture, moves his lips, imitating the facial expressions of a person when speaking.

The described fields are mandatory to fill in and are the minimum requirement for obtaining the expected result - a talking character.

## Message

The answer to the message can be of 3 types: **text, audio and video**.
